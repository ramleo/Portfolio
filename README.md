# portfolio
This is my portfolio website

I converted my portfolio into a website (I am a beginner in web development so trying something new)
It includes:
- Job details
- Core-competencies
- Projects
- Technical skills
- Personal details
- Educational details

It also includes different projects done by me like exploratory data analysis, machine learning, deep learning, model interpretation and many more....
